Attending: Vera, Tim, Siavash, Javier, Sidney, Aryan, Jack, Isabella, Karime, Elena

By the end of this meeting, you should be able to

* Use the following commands fluently:
  * `git clone`
  * `git pull`
  * `git commit`
  * `git push`
* Read in and plot data from a file

## Paper

"Novel constraints on non-cold (non-thermal) Dark Matter from Lyman-alpha forest data"



## Exercise (intro to using git and visualizing data)

1. Create a new 'cosmolab-scratchwork' repository via GitHub (name it whatever you want),
and add `veragluscevic` and `timothydmorton` as collaborators on this repo.
Initialize with a README, choose 'python' from the .gitignore options, and MIT
license.
2. Clone this new repo to your machine.
3. Edit the readme file, commit and push the changes (play around with [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)!).  See this on GitHub!
4. Clone `https://github.com/veragluscevic/usc-cosmolab-hackspace` to your machine.
5. From within your new repo, make a jupyter notebook and use it to ingest
and visualize the lyman-alpha data from the usc-cosmolab repo (`data/lyman-alpha.txt`).
6. Commit and push your notebook as you make changes.
